<p><strong>Thermic Effect Foods Harvard</strong>, Thermal effect of food the energy, or calories, it takes to digest, absorb, and metabolize nutrients is the thermal effect of food (tef). Foods that are higher in protein and carbs (as opposed to fat) are more likely to increase the thermic effect. And indulging in fatty foods for even a short time can worsen your metabolism. Fat, when ingested, is stored in the adipose tissues.</p>

The thermic effect of food is a measure of how much different foods increase energy expenditure, due to the energy required to digest, absorb and metabolize the nutrients.
