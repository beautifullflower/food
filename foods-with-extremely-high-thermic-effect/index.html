<p><strong>Foods With Extremely High Thermic Effect</strong>, When you consume a diet heavy in thermic foods, the idea is that even while resting, your metabolic rate will be higher. The energy used to digest food is known as the thermic effect of feeding. Camouflagible foods like mushrooms, spinach, squash and cauliflower can be added sneaked into meals to add nutrition and potentially replace higher calorie ingredients. Bison has a very high thermic effect while containing all of the essential amino acids to build muscle, a high protein count to help keep you satisfied longer.</p>
