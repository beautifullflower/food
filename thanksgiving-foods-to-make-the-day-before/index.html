The cranberry glaze is a really beautiful color, and the sugared cranberries are the perfect topping. Make the soup and crisp the chorizo bits 3 days ahead, but don�t add the lemon juice until right before serving.</p>

<p>Everything You Can Make the Day Before Thanksgiving The turkey is usually prepared whole, filled with fruit, vegetables or other stuffing (more on stuffing in #2!). Prepare turkey or vegetable stock (if you are using homemade). From mashed potatoes and stuffing, to gravy and casseroles, these are the thanksgiving sides to make ahead. Box up all nonperishable items that you don’t need until thanksgiving. Seriously, put in a little prep work a day or two in advance, and you�ll <em>finally</em> be free to dive into the charcuterie and chardonnay by 3 p.m. For stuffing, prepare dried bread one to two days in advance.</p>

<p>Leftover Thanksgiving Stuffing Waffles Recipe Making it a day before was a good idea. On thanksgiving day, remove the turkey from the refrigerator and let sit to come to room temperature before reheating. Simply prepare the bread cubes, sausage and vegetables, then stop and freeze. Veggie platters or roasted veggies, like these roasted carrots , are great for turkey day. From mashed potatoes to comforting casseroles, these are the 30 best dishes to make ahead and freeze. It’s also usually seasoned, which means covered in herbs for flavor and smell.</p>
