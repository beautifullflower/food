<p>Baby Led Weaning Basics from a Mom of Three Baby first If your doctor has advised that you can wean baby before 6 months, then you can offer them smooth pureed food from a spoon. There�s no right or wrong way. This is especially true when compared to the traditional weaning method using purées. Full of essential nutrients for a growing baby, these first foods also taste delicious from the very first bite. You want foods to be finger sized so they are large enough that baby can’t force the whole piece into their mouth, and a shape that’s easy for a 6 month old to hold with their chubby little hands. Oily fish, such as mackerel, salmon and sardines, are great for your baby, but can contain low levels of toxins, so limit servings to once or twice a week (bnf 2009).</p>
