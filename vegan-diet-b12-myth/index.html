<p>40 Year Vegan Dies of a Heart Attack! The Omega3 and B12 But in practice, many vegans don’t. First i must state that this myth is partly based in fact (partly!). You need only a little b12 (1.5 micrograms a day), but that small amount is vital for maintaining healthy nerve cells and other important functions.

So people who then consume the meat from these animals are just receiving the b12 which originally came from the supplements fed to the animals. The only reliable vegan sources of b12 are foods fortified with b12 (including some plant milks, some soy products and some breakfast cereals) and b12 supplements.</p>
